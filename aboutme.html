            			I am currently pursuing B.tech in computer science from IIT Roorkee. Since then I have worked mainly as an Online and Web Designer, Video editor/producer and Marketing & Communications specialist for Dutch and international clients, organizations and companies, such as Statistics Netherlands (CBS), HCO, BCC, municipal Wassenaar, Heemstede, Bloemendaal and KPN. I have gained experience with web design, social media, graphic design, storytelling, video editing, shooting footage, motion graphics, online assets, e-mailings, photography, writing, coaching, teaching and project management.

						Currently I'm focussing on developing myself (further) in the direction of web development and competitive programming. Next to my job as webmaster and trainer/coach at Servicecenter Drechtsteden (municipal Dordrecht, Papendrecht, Zwijndrecht, Sliedrecht, Alblasserdam, Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht and several other municipalities in this area), I have some time left for other interesting film, video and photo projects.

						In my spare time I'm currently working on a documentary. Before, I’ve been part of the film-crew of the movie “Goeie Mie recomposed”, which premièred at the Leiden International Film Festival in October 2016. Also I was part of the (on- and offline) promotional team. Furthermore, in a small team with friends, we’ve created the local music TV show “4themusic” inspired by “Later… with Jools Holland”. This show is broadcast twice a month on a local TV station (Unity TV). Some years ago with other friends, we've setup and run a biological eating café. Another hobby is traveling and I’ve visited many places in the world.
